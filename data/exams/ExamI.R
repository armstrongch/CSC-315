# CSC 315, Exam I 

# Directions: Modify this script to add R code in order to answer the questions 
# and/or complete the steps below. 

# When you are finished, create a Notebook and submit this assignment
# through Blackboard at https://ct-ecsu.blackboard.com/webapps/login/

# Name: 

# 1. Create a vector called ages that contains the numbers 1-20, 24, and 32

# 2. Write a function in R called first.last which takes a vector x as an argument 
#    and returns a list containing two named elements, the first element of x and the
#    last element of x. Use this function to find the first and last element of the 
#    vector ages from problem (1). 


#    The following command reads in a previous class survey dataset 
#    and stores the table in the variable 'survey'. Use this table 
#    to answer the remaining questions
  
    survey = read.delim("http://pastebin.com/raw/1csmBawE")

# 3. Construct a scatterplot of  Alcohol Consumption on the x-axis and 
#    College GPA on the y-axis. Find the correlation and describe
#    the trend in the data.

# 4. Fit a linear model that predicts college GPA from alcohol consumption.
#    (a) Add the regression line to the scatterplot
#    (b) Find and interpret the slope and y-intercept.
#    (c) What is the predicted college GPA for someone who drinks
#        1 day / week?    
    
    
# 5. What is the 90th percentile for College GPA?    
     
# 6. Find the mean and variance of Alcohol consumption
    
# 7. Find the mean GPA for individuals that do not consume Alcohol 
#     (i.e., where Alconol consumption is 0)
      
# 8. Construct a histogram of FB usage, and describe the shape of the histogram. 
#   Is it unimodal, bimodal, or flat. Is it skewed right, skewed left, or symmetric?

# 9. Construct a stacked bar graph using the conditional proportions
#    to determine if there is an association between gender and 
#    views on marijuana legalization, and describe the association. Make 
#    sure to include a legend on the graph, give the graph a title, and
#    a y-axis label.  

   
# Extra Credit
# In a single R statement, construct a frequency tables for
# a person's views on Marijuana Legalization and Same Sex Marriage
# legalization. Note: you may only write the 'table' function once
