# Add R code to the script below and create a Notebook to complete
# the steps and explicitly answer the following questions
##########################################################################

# 1.load our classes survey data (available at http://pastebin.com/raw/QDSga7qF)
#    and add the code for this to the script. 


# 2. How many students completed the survey?


# 3. How many questions were asked (i.e., how many columns are there)?


# 4. Construct a frequency table for whether someone prefers C++, Java, or Python


# 5. Construct a Pareto Chart for whether someone prefers Dunkin Donuts,
#    Starbucks, or has no preference
#    Give the chart an appropriate title by setting the 'main'
#    argument and an appropriate y-axis label by setting the
#   'ylab' argument.


# 6. Construct a relative frequency table indicating whether or not a student consumes alcohol
#    (i.e., consumes alcohol > 0 days per week).


# 7. Consider just the individuals who chose "Dog person" over "Cat person".
#   What proportion of these individuals would rather fight 1 horse-sized
#   duck than 100 duck-sized horses?
#   Find the same proportion for the individuals who chose "Cat person" over
#   "Dog person". What do you conclude based on this data for our class?


# 8. Construct a histogram for HS GPA, and describe the shape of its distribution. 
#    Is it unimodal, bimodal, or flat. Is it skewed right, skewed left, or symmetric?


# 9. Calculate the mean and median for HS GPA? (Note: watch out for
#    missing values for all questions dealing with HS GPA).
#    Which is a better measure of average HS GPA? Justify your answer.


# 10. What is the 80th percentile for HS GPA? ()

# 11. Ten percent of indivduals have HS GPAs above what value?

# 12. Create side-by-side boxplots showing the College GPA based on
#     whether or not an individual prefers to fight 1 horse-sized duck
#     or 100 duck-sized horses. Make sure to give your graph
#     an appropriate title and y-axis label. Does there appear 
#     to be a significant difference in the GPAs between these 
#     two groups? Are there any outliers? If so, how many?

# 13. Which is more variable, HS GPA or College GPA. (Hint: be careful of missing values)
#     You must justify your answer to receive credit.

# 14. Create a vector of length 100 that has a standard deviation of 0.
